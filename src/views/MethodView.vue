            How do we create the entire thing?
        </h2>
        <p> we trained our model using Tensorflow 2.0, and we use a Tensorflowjs converter to convert the model in the json format to read it in the brower. We created this website using Vue.js and Vite. We imported the model in the browser, and we use Tensorflowjs to make the prediction. We then output the results to spotify api and create html embeds for the results.</p>
